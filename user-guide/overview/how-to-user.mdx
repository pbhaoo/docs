### 了解平台服务

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion  title="充分知悉平台提供的功能">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion  title="了解API">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```

  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.

  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
